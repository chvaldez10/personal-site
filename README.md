# Personal Site

### Welcome to My Personal Site!

This is a personal site to showcase my projects and skills.

### üöÄ Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering.
- **TypeScript**: Adds static types to JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for UI development.
- **Shadcn/UI**: A modern UI component library for React.
- **Supabase**: Database and real-time data synchronization.
- **Vercel**: Deployment platform.

### üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and change your directory to `chvaldez10`.
3. Since react-bubble-ui is a peer dependency, you need to set the peer dependency in your npm config, so run `npm config set legacy-peer-deps true`.
4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
5. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your Supabase credentials.
6. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
7. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view your site.
